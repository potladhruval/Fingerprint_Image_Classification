# Fingerprint_Image_Classification
This project aims at improving the classification of blurry fingerprint Images using several image restoration and enhancement techniques predominantly in the frequency domain. Fingerprints are classified based on gender(Male or Female). Fingerprints are composed of ridges and furrows and are one of the unique traits used for identification of an individual. There are some significant differences between male and female fingerprints. Female fingerprints exhibit higher ridge densities than male fingerprints. This means that female fingerprints have narrower ridges as compared to male fingerprints. However with increasing age people exhibit a decrease in the ridge density.
